Case study:


The research group from the Department of Social Sciences is conducting a statistical survey to examine how demographic and professional variables influence the accumulated wealth of billionaires.
After carrying out an exploratory analysis of the collected data, determine a possible correlation between:

- The gender of billionaires and their industry sector (e.g., technology, finance, manufacturing).
- The age of billionaires and their net worth (finalWorth), distinguishing between age groups (e.g., under 40, 40â€“60, over 60).
